# Predicting Restaurant Success using Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews and Ratings

## Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that identifies key factors contributing to the long-term success of restaurants.  We analyze online reviews and ratings data to understand the correlation between sentiment expressed in reviews, numerical ratings, and the restaurant's longevity and consistent high ratings.  The analysis involves sentiment analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to predict restaurant success based on these factors.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will print various analysis results to the console, including descriptive statistics of the dataset, key findings from the sentiment analysis, and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the following plot files will be generated in the `output` directory:

* `sentiment_distribution.png`: A visualization of the distribution of sentiment scores in the reviews.
* `rating_vs_longevity.png`: A scatter plot showing the relationship between average rating and restaurant longevity.
* (Other plots as generated by the analysis)


## Data

The project utilizes a dataset of restaurant reviews and ratings.  (Optional: Add details about the data source, size, and format here.  If the data is not publicly available, remove this section or state it's not included).

## Future Work

(Optional: Add potential future improvements or extensions to the project, e.g., incorporating other data sources, exploring different machine learning models, improving feature engineering techniques.)

## Contributing
